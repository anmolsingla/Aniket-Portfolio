            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India is provided by public schools (controlled and funded
                by three levels: central, state and local) and private schools. Under various articles of the Indian
                Constitution, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children between the
                ages of 6 and 14. The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is 7:5.
                India has made progress in increasing the attainment rate of primary education. In 2011, Approximately
                75% of the population, aged between 7 and 10 years, was literate.[6] India's improved education system
                is often cited as one of the main contributors to its economic development.[7] Much of the progress,
                especially in higher education and scientific research, has been credited to various public
                institutions. While enrolment in higher education has increased steadily over the past decade, reaching
                a Gross Enrollment Ratio of 24% in 2013,[8] there still remains a significant distance to catch up with
                tertiary education enrolment levels of developed nations,[9] a challenge that will be necessary to
                overcome in order to continue to reap a demographic dividend from India's comparatively young
                population. </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">As per the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2012, 96.5% of all
                rural children between the ages of 6-14 were enrolled in school. This is the fourth annual survey to
                report enrollment above 96%. India has maintained an average enrolment ratio of 95% for students in this
                age group from year 2007 to 2014. As an outcome the number of students in the age group 6-14 who are not
                enrolled in school has come down to 2.8% in the year academic year 2018 (ASER 2018).[12] Another report
                from 2013 stated that there were 229 million students enrolled in different accredited urban and rural
                schools of India, from Class I to XII, representing an increase of 23 lakh students over 2002 total
                enrolment, and a 19% increase in girl's enrolment.[13] While quantitatively India is inching closer to
                universal education, the quality of its education has been questioned particularly in its government run
                school system.While more than 95 percent of children attend primary school, just 40 percent of Indian
                adolescents attend secondary school (Grades 9-12). Since 2000, the World Bank has committed over $2
                billion to education in India. Some of the reasons for the poor quality include absence of around 25% of
                teachers every day.[14] States of India have introduced tests and education assessment system to
                identify and improve such schools.[1</p>
